Problem 1:

Write C++ function that can perform the following task:

Design a function that can read an array from the user
Design a function that can print the entered array
Design a function that can print the array in reverse order
Design a function that can print only the odd elements of the user array
Problem 2:
Write C++ function that can perform the following task:

Create an array of integers and initialize it with random values.
Ask the user to input a value to search for in the array.
Implement a linear search algorithm to find and display the index of the first occurrence of the input value. If the value is not found, display a message indicating so.
Problem 3:

Create a program that:

Defines a function that takes two integer pointers as arguments.
Inside the function, swap the values pointed to by the two pointers.
In the main program, declare two integers and initialize them with values.
Call the function to swap the values.
Display the values before and after the swap.
